It is our pleasure to thank Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA), 
the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) and Microsoft Research for the support of the 
EMCSR 2014 Summer school; School of Computer Science of the University of St Andrews
for providing the venue and technical support; EPSRC for supporting the Recomputation.org
project. We would like also to thank all attendees and speakers at the summer school (even
though it's not common to acknowledge co-authors of the paper, which include all of them).
