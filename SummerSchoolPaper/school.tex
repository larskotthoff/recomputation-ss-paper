Kenji Takeda: how cloud computing can enable recomputable and
reproducible experiments.

software in reproducible computational experiments.

Darren Kidney: using standard statistical tools such as R and Sweave
to create recomputable papers.

Tristan Henderson: the role and challenges of data sharing in
reproducible research.
