\section{The state of the art}
\label{s:recomputation}

In this section we are going to describe the current state of reproducible computational science, and
in particular the Recomputation.org project, which is aimed at implementing
the infrastructure for recomputable experiments following the statements of the Recomputation
Manifesto \cite{gent:recomputation}. We will give an overview of other activities in this
direction, such as, for example, the Mozilla Science Lab, GitHub and Figshare joint project to fix code
citations by assigning a DOI to the particular revision, and training initiatives such as Software
Carpentry to increase the awareness of researchers about tools that they can use to make their
research more reproducible -- in other words, promote ``Recomputaliteracy'' (a word coined by 
Ian Gent at one of the group discussions at the Collaborations Workshop 2014).
