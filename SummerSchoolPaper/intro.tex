\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

This paper has been written during the week of the Summer School
on Experimental Methodology in Computational Science Research.
\footnote{St Andrews, Scotland, August 4-8, 2014,
\url{https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/emcsr2014/}} The 
school was comprising of lectures, tutorials and a hackathon,
all united by the topic of reproducible research in computational
sciences. 

One goal of the Summer School was to write a paper about reproducible research in
Computational Sciences \emph{by the end of the week}, and this is what you are reading now.
The hackathon aspect of the Summer School therefore became focussed on working on this paper
and then writing it. 

For the hackathon (actually split into several sessions), attendees 
were asked to `bring a paper', i.e. to bring the suggestion of a 
computational experiment to be reproduced as part of the summer school. 
The experiment should be either from a published paper or, if unpublished, 
have the agreement of all authors concerned for this activity including 
the publication of a replication.  

Following participants' presentations of their 
selected papers, we decided that they fell naturally into three topics, 
and three groups were performed to work on these topics as case studies.
The resulting case studies will be presented below
in Sections~\ref{s:group1}~--~\ref{s:group3}.
