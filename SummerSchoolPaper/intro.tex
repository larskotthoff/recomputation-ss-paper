\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

This paper has been written during the week of the Summer School
on Experimental Methodology in Computational Science Research
\footnote{St Andrews, Scotland, August 4-8, 2014,
\url{https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/emcsr2014/}}. The 
school was comprising of lectures, tutorials and a hackday,
all united by the topic of reproducible research in computational
sciences. 

For the hackday (actually split into several sessions), attendees 
were asked to `bring a paper', i.e. to bring the suggestion of a 
computational experiment to be reproduced as part of the summer school. 
The experiment should be either from a published paper or, if unpublished, 
have the agreement of all authors concerned for this activity including 
the publication of a replication. 

After forming teams and selecting projects for the hackday, three
topics for the case studies were selected. These will be presented below
in Sections~\ref{s:group1}~--~\ref{s:group3}.
