\section{Case study \#1: Ethical requirements for recomputation}

\subsection{Introduction}
The goal of recomputation\footnote{http://www.recomputation.org/} is to follow the recompilation manifesto\footnote{http://www.recomputation.org/blog/2013/04/12/the-recomputation-manifesto/} and make computational experiments recomputable by providing tools and a repository to store experiments in. The mission is stated as:
\begin{quote}
``If we can compute your experiment now, anyone can recompute it 20 years from now''
\end{quote}

One of the considerations perhaps under considered in regards to recomputation to date is the ethical implications. 
\subsection{Background}

\subsection{Comparison of Ethical Requirements across Universities}

Through examination of ethics submissions from ten institutions across the UK, EU, and US,
we aim to discover a set of ethical concerns common to all. 
Our analysis uncovered 145 unique fields, 
encompassing generic details, such as contact details of co-investigators, methodological
details, and institution-specific requirements, often for insurance and liability purposes.
Of these fields, only two were common to all ten ethics forms - the name of the principal
investigator, and whether informed consent was sought. While this is clearly insufficient
as a minimum specification for capturing ethics requirements, it reveals the crux of the 
ethics approval process is to ensure participant agency is maintained through the experimental process by mandating informed consent.

Examining the frequency with which these fields occur highlights the 

% which fields occur frequently

% thematic overlaps

% surprisingly small common set

% what are the outliers - are they important?
