\section{Introduction}
The goal of recomputation\footnote{http://www.recomputation.org/} is to follow the recompilation manifesto\footnote{http://www.recomputation.org/blog/2013/04/12/the-recomputation-manifesto/} and make computational experiments recomputable by providing tools and a repository to store experiments in. The mission is stated as:
\begin{quote}
If we can compute your experiment now, anyone can recompute it 20 years from now
\end{quote}

One of the considerations perhaps under considered in regards to recomputation to date is the ethical implications.
