\section{Obstacles to recomputation}
\label{s:obstacles}

Describe the obstacles that we have discovered; basically a
description of all the talks and a distillation of the challenges.

Obstacles and Challenges (perhaps a table showing which case studies
are revealing them):

\begin{itemize}
\item Technical:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Long-term persistence
  \item In some areas it's harder to create reproducible experiments than in others
\end{itemize}

\item
Legal and ethical:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data protection issues: personal data drifting into VMs
  \item Licensing issues
  \end{itemize}
  

\item
Community building:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  why to make your research reproducible
  \item how to motivate your colleagues/collaborators/supervisors/etc
  \end{itemize}
\item From Discussion
\begin{itemize} 

\item Performance measurement
\item ability to get ethical consent.  Did they ask to release the data in a form we can use?
\item how much knowledge is needed to rerun an experiment
\item Ease of reproduction vs independent reproducibility
\item Automation tradeoff - recomputation tends to need automated systems
\item You don't know what data was decided not to publish in the paper 
  \end{itemize}

  
\end{itemize}
