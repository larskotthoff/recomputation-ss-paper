\section{Obstacles to Reproducibility in Computational Sciences}
\label{s:obstacles}

There are many obstacles to reproducibility.   Several of these were discussed by various speakers during the week.  They were also discussed by the participants.

Amongst the obstances and challenges that we identified are the following (although not intended to be an exhaustive list.) 

\begin{itemize}
\item Technical:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Long-term persistence
  \item In some areas it's harder to create reproducible experiments than in others
\end{itemize}

\item
Legal and ethical:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data protection issues: personal data drifting into VMs
  \item Licensing issues
  \end{itemize}
  

\item
Community building:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  why to make your research reproducible
  \item how to motivate your colleagues/collaborators/supervisors/etc
  \end{itemize}
\item From Discussion
\begin{itemize} 

\item Performance measurement
\item ability to get ethical consent.  Did they ask to release the data in a form we can use?
\item how much knowledge is needed to rerun an experiment
\item Ease of reproduction vs independent reproducibility
\item Automation tradeoff - recomputation tends to need automated systems
\item You don't know what data was decided not to publish in the paper 
  \end{itemize}

  
\end{itemize}
