\section{Obstacles to recomputation}
\label{s:obstacles}

Describe the obstacles that we have discovered; basically a
description of all the talks and a distillation of the challenges.

Obstacles and Challenges (perhaps a table showing which case studies
are revealing them):

- Technical:
 
  * Long-term persistence
  * In some areas it's harder to create reproducible experiments than in others

- Legal and ethical:
  * Data protection issues: personal data drifting into VMs
  * Licensing issues

- Community building:

  * why to make your research reproducible
  * how to motivate your colleagues/collaborators/supervisors/etc
