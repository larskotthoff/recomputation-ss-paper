\section{Discussion}
\label{s:discussion}

After presenting the case studies, in this section we are going to summarise 
obstacles that we have met in which case studies. In the final version of the 
paper we are going to describe lessons learned, suggest recommendations 
that could be made from it, and outline possible further directions of addressing 
the issues that we've identified.
