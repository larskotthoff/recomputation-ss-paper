A list of the papers and experiments described by participants. Please
correct any errors and add paper information, DOIs etc!

Ciaran McCreesh
- paper on the effects of work-stealing
- might be tricky to reproduce! Good!

DaniÃ«l Reijsbergen
- a graph-theoretic paper from PhD thesis
- a more recent paper using R

Michael Bareford
- a paper on coronal heating

Ben Goreman
- HCI accessibility experiments might be too hard to reproduce on
  Azure

Karen Petrie
- Combination: automated generation of puzzles with constraints
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1982185.1982383
- a combination of HCI and AI research

Sylwester Arabas
- looking at real "clouds"! Precipitation measurements.
- has a dataset and code for the intensity of precipitation. Monte
  Carlo code uses GPUs and so might be vendor-specific and therefore
  challenging to reproduce on the cloud.

Luke Hutton
- Privacy: is there an app for that?
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2078827.2078843

Ruma Paul
- wants to reproduce experiments from structured networks

Masih Hajiarabderkani
- interested in distributed hash tables
- wants to take data collected from a single machine and run these on
  multiple machines
