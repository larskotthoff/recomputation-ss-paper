A list of the papers and experiments described by participants. Please
correct any errors and add paper information, DOIs etc!

Ciaran McCreesh
- paper on the effects of work-stealing
- might be tricky to reproduce! Good!

DaniÃ«l Reijsbergen
- a graph-theoretic paper from PhD thesis
- a more recent paper using R

Michael Bareford
- a paper on coronal heating

Ben Gorman
- HCI accessibility experiments might be too hard to reproduce on
  Azure

Karen Petrie
- Combination: automated generation of puzzles with constraints
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1982185.1982383
- a combination of HCI and AI research

Sylwester Arabas
- looking at real "clouds"! Precipitation simulations.
- open code + docs on arXiv (http://libcloudphxx.igf.fuw.edu.pl/)
- Monte Carlo code uses GPUs (optionally, but makes it run much faster)
  and so might be vendor-specific and therefore challenging
  to reproduce on the cloud.

Luke Hutton
- Privacy: is there an app for that?
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2078827.2078843

Ruma Paul
- wants to reproduce experiments from structured networks

Masih Hajiarabderkani
- interested in distributed hash tables
- wants to take data collected from a single machine and run these on
  multiple machines

Kenji Takeda
- interested in how cloud computing can be used to enable reproducible research, with a focus on Azure
