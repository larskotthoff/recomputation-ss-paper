* Title
    * new working title: *Experiences and Challenges in Reproducible Computational Science*
        * is there an issue of renaming paper already on arxiv?
    * focus is on experience report from the summer school groups
    * raising issues and challenges for reproducibility
    * no claim conclusions from case studies are generally valid

* Structure
    * Intro: Ian
    * Background: Tristan
        * Introducing the four case studies and the problems they address
    * Four case studies, 
        * about 2 pages each

        * Results

        * Reproducibility of this paper

* Case Study 1, Group 1: Luke will write-up the work we did with the ethics forms and the 
implications of that, merging in Karen's background text.

* Case Study 2, Group 2: Ciaran will do the parallel bits, but not before the 20th or so.

* Case Study 3, Group 3: Daniel and Michael have added their sections, Slywester may still have some material to add. We've yet to finalise the location of the VM image that holds the data for all three non-CS recomputations.

* Case Study 4: Miguel
    * If any of the subgroups have R or SPSS code they used, please put it in repo

* Citations
    * Make sure each section is bolstered with proper citations
    * Titus Brown similar experience http://figshare.com/articles/Channeling_community_contributions_to_scientific_software_a_hackathon_experience/1112541

* Non paper things
    * VMs where appropriate
        * are they releasable legally/ethically?
        * If not discuss in paper
    * Create VM for paper so it is always remakable: Ian
